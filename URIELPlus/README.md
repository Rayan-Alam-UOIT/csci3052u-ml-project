# [URIEL+: Enhancing Linguistic Inclusion and Usability in a Typological and Multilingual Knowledge Base](https://aclanthology.org/2025.coling-main.463/)

![knowledge base for natural language processing](./logo.png)

URIEL is a knowledge base offering geographical, phylogenetic, and typological vector representations for 7970 languages. It includes distance measures between these vectors for 4005 languages, which are accessible via the lang2vec tool. Despite being frequently cited, URIEL is limited in terms of linguistic inclusion and overall usability. To tackle these challenges, we introduce URIEL+, an enhanced version of URIEL and lang2vec addressing these limitations. In addition to expanding typological feature coverage for 2898 languages, URIEL+ improves user experience with robust, customizable distance calculations to better suit the needs of the users. These upgrades also offer competitive performance on downstream tasks and provide distances that better align with linguistic distance studies.

## Environment

The core package is tested on Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12. It does not require TensorFlow, TensorFlow Addons, MIDASpy, or the optional imputation libraries.

## Setup Instruction

+ To get started with URIEL+:
    ```bash
    pip install urielplus
    ```

    ```python
    from urielplus import urielplus

    u = urielplus.URIELPlus()
    ```

+ Optional KNN, mean, and SoftImpute dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install "urielplus[imputation]"
    ```

+ MIDASpy is isolated to a Python 3.10 environment:
    ```bash
    pip install "urielplus[midaspy]"
    ```

## Configuration Options Examples

+ URIEL+ offers various configurations that you can adjust:
    - Caching: Enable or disable caching (True or False).
    - Aggregation Method: Choose the method for aggregating data across sources ('U' for unweighted, 'A' for weighted).
    - Fill Missing Data: Decide whether to fill missing data using parent language data (True or False).
    - Distance Metric: Specify the distance metric to be used ("angular" or "cosine").
    - Include Lineage In Eval: Decide whether values filled in via parent language (lineage) data during imputation are included when evaluating imputation quality (True or False).
    - Restrict eWAVE To Own Languages: Decide whether eWAVE-exclusive features are restricted to eWAVE's own languages (plus `"stan1293"`) (True or False).

+ Changing A Configuration:
    ```python
    u.set_{configuration}({option})
    ```

+ Checking A Configuration:
    ```python
    u.get_{configuration}()
    ```

+ Replace `{configuration}` with `cache`, `aggregation`, `fill_with_base_lang`, `distance_metric`, `include_lineage_in_eval`, or `restrict_ewave_to_own_languages`.
+ Replace `{option}` with your desired value for the selected configuration.
+ Note: the default configurations are `cache=False`, `aggregation='U'`, `fill_with_base_lang=True`, `distance_metric="angular"`, `include_lineage_in_eval=False`, and `restrict_ewave_to_own_languages=True`.
+ NOTE: Setting `restrict_ewave_to_own_languages` to `True` immediately and irreversibly forces eWAVE-exclusive feature values for languages outside eWAVE's scope to -1 (missing) the next time that data is accessed or computed on. Setting it back to `False` afterward does not restore those values, unless URIEL+ is reset.

## Retrieving Loaded Features Examples

+ Retrieving A Loaded Feature:
    ```python
    u.get_{vector_type}_{feature_type}_array()
    ```
+ Replace `{vector_type}` with `phylogeny`, `typological`, `geography`, or `script`.
+ Replace `{feature_type}` with `features`, `languages`, `data`, or `sources`.

+ Example:
    ```python
    u.get_typological_languages_array()
    ```

## Database Integration Examples

+ NOTE: `integrate_databases()` integrates **all** available databases, including eWAVE and APiCS, which you may not want. eWAVE adds hundreds of features that only apply to English dialects, and APiCS adds hundreds of features but has data for only 76 languages. Both can add substantial sparsity and features you may not need. To exclude them, integrate only the databases you want, either individually or in one call (see "Integrating Only Some Databases" below).

+ Integrating All Databases:
    ```python
    u.integrate_databases()
    ```
+ Integrating One Database:
    ```python
    u.integrate_{database}()
    ```
+ Integrating Only Some Databases (Excluding Others):
    ```python
    u.integrate_custom_databases({databases})
    ```

+ Example: Integrating Every Database Except eWAVE and APiCS
    ```python
    # Option 1: one call
    u.integrate_custom_databases("UPDATED_SAPHON", "BDPROTO", "GRAMBANK", "GLOTTOLOG")

    # Option 2: one database at a time
    u.integrate_saphon()
    u.integrate_bdproto()
    u.integrate_grambank()
    u.integrate_glottolog()
    ```

+ Set Language Codes to Glottocodes:
    ```python
    u.set_glottocodes()
    ```

+ Reset all changes:
    ```python
    u.reset()
    ```

+ NOTE: `reset()` only resets URIEL+'s in-memory attributes back to their initial state. It does not change or delete any files that were already written to disk when caching was enabled. If you want those cached files reset as well, you will need to remove or replace them manually.

+ Replace `{database}` with `saphon`, `bdproto`, `grambank`, `apics`, `ewave`, or `glottolog`.
+ Replace `{databases}` with arguments `"UPDATED_SAPHON"`, `"BDPROTO"`, `"GRAMBANK"`, `"APICS"`, `"EWAVE"`, and/or `"GLOTTOLOG"` (e.g., `"UPDATED_SAPHON"`, `"BDPROTO"`, `"EWAVE"`).

## Language Codes Examples

+ Checking How Languages Are Currently Identified:
    ```python
    u.get_codes()
    ```
+ Returns `"Iso"` if languages are identified with ISO 639-3 codes, or `"Glotto"` if identified with Glottocodes. Defaults to `"Iso"`.

+ Checking If A Code Is An ISO 639-3 Code:
    ```python
    u.is_iso_code({language})
    ```

+ Checking If A Code Is A Glottocode:
    ```python
    u.is_glottocode({language})
    ```

+ Retrieving Dialects:
    ```python
    u.get_dialects()
    ```
+ Returns a dictionary mapping the index of each base language in URIEL+'s typological languages array to a list of its dialect language codes. Works with either ISO 639-3 codes or Glottocodes, based on the current setting from `get_codes()`.

+ Replace `{language}` with a language code (e.g., `"stan1293"`, `"eng"`).

## Imputation Examples

+ Aggregate Typological and Script Data:
    ```python
    u.set_aggregation({aggregation}) 
    u.aggregate()
    ```

+ Impute Missing Values:
    ```python
    u.{imputation_strategy}_imputation()
    ```

+ Replace `{aggregation}` with `'U'` (union) or `'A'` (average).
+ Replace `{imputation_strategy}` with `midaspy`, `knn`, `softimpute`, or `mean`.

+ Retrieving The Languages Filled In Via Lineage-Based Imputation:
    ```python
    u.get_lineage_imputed_indices()
    ```
+ Returns the set of language indices whose values were filled in using parent language (lineage) data during the most recent imputation run. Used together with the `include_lineage_in_eval` configuration when evaluating imputation quality.

+ Manually Setting The Lineage-Imputed Indices:
    ```python
    u.set_lineage_imputed_indices({indices})
    ```
+ Replace `{indices}` with a set of language indices (e.g., `{0, 4, 7}`).

## Language Distance Calculation Examples

+ Calculate a Specific Distance:
    ```python
    print(u.new_distance({distance_type}, {languages}))
    ```

+ Calculate Distance Using Specific Features:
    ```python
    print(u.new_custom_distance({features}, {languages}, source={source}))
    ```

+ Retrieve Language Vectors:
    ```python
    u.get_vector({distance_type}, {languages})
    ```

+ View URIEL+ Feature Coverage For All Resource Levels And Distance Types:
    ```python
    u.all_feature_coverage()
    ```

+ View URIEL+ Feature Coverage For A Specific Resource Level And Distance Type:
    ```python
    u.feature_coverage({resource_level}, {distance_type})
    ```
+ Replace `{resource_level}` with `"high-resource"`, `"medium-resource"`, or `"low-resource"`.

+ Calculate Confidence Scores for Distances
    ```python
    print(u.confidence_score({language 1}, {language 2}, {distance_type}))
    ```

+ Replace `{distance_type}` with a distance type (`"genetic"`, `"syntactic"`, `"featural"`, `"phonological"`, `"inventory"`, `"geographic"`, `"morphological"`, or `"script"`) or a list of distance types (e.g., `["syntactic", "phonological"]`). Must be a single distance type for retrieving language vectors and calculating feature coverage or confidence scores.
+ Replace `{features}` with a list of current features (e.g., `["S_SUBJECT_BEFORE_VERB", "P_VOICE"]`).
+ Replace `{languages}`, `{language 1}`, and `{language 2}` with language codes (e.g., `"stan1293"`, `"hind1269"`).
+ Replace `{source}` with one database (e.g., `"WALS"`) or all databases (`'A'`).
+ Note: the default `{source}` is all databases.
